# Smart Fruit Drying System

This repository contains the **Smart Fruit Drying System** project developed as part of our **Software Engineering** module.  
The project demonstrates how software engineering principles are applied to solve real-world problems using structured design, modeling, and requirements engineering.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Summary
The Smart Fruit Drying System addresses the challenges of efficient fruit preservation by automating the drying process.  
We broke down the problem into sub-problems and modeled the system using **use case diagrams, requirements modeling, and activity diagrams**.  

### Key points:
- Introduces **use case diagram** covering all sub-problems.
- Provides a **requirements model** with outline and detailed use case specifications.
- Includes **activity diagram** for one of the critical use cases.
- Designed as a **group project**, applying collaborative software engineering practices.

  
## ðŸ›  Tools & Methods
- **Software Engineering Models:** Use case diagram, requirements model, activity diagram
- **Documentation:** Structured according to SE principles
- **Team Collaboration:** Project developed as a group

  ## ðŸ‘¥ Teamwork
This was a **group project** developed with fellow Computer Systems Engineering students.  
Each member contributed to modeling, documentation, and system design.
